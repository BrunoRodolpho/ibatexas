## 5. Admin Actions Matrix

| Action | Required Role | Fulfillment Status | Payment Status | Notes |
|--------|-------------|-------------------|----------------|-------|
| Force cancel order | MANAGER+ | Any non-terminal | Any | Cancels payment too |

| Issue partial refund | MANAGER+ | Any | `paid` | Transitions → partially_refunded |
| Override payment status | OWNER | Any | Any | Emergency override |

## 6. System Actions

| Trigger | Action | Order Impact | Payment Impact |
|---------|--------|-------------|----------------|
| PIX QR expires (30min) | Transition payment | None | `payment_pending` → `payment_expired` |
| Stripe webhook: succeeded | Reconcile payment | Auto-confirm if pending | → `paid` |
| Stripe webhook: failed | Reconcile payment | None | → `payment_failed` |
| Stripe webhook: dispute | Reconcile payment | None | → `disputed` |
| 24h unpaid order | Stale order cleanup | Cancel order | Cancel payment |
| Payment → `paid` event | Auto-confirm order | `pending` → `confirmed` | — |
| Payment → `refunded` event | Cancel order (if pending/confirmed) | → `canceled` | — |

**Critical invariant:** PIX expiry NEVER cancels the order. Only the stale order checker (24h) auto-cancels unpaid orders.

## 8. Validation Rules Summary

### Universal Rules (all channels, all order types)
1. **Canceled orders are immutable** — no actions allowed
2. **Delivered orders are immutable** — except notes and refund requests
3. **Paid payments block method switch** — must refund first
4. **Terminal payment statuses are per-attempt** — retry creates NEW row
5. **PONR is per-item, per-action** — different windows for amend vs cancel
6. **Rate limits are per-customer AND per-order** — both must pass
7. **All mutations require distributed lock** — payment-level or order-level
8. **Version field enforces optimistic concurrency** — stale writes fail

### Order Type-Specific Rules
1. **Delivery orders cannot pay with cash** — no cash on delivery
2. **Dine-in orders have relaxed PONR** — can amend until `preparing`
3. **Pickup/dine-in show `ready` as final pre-customer state** — no `in_delivery`

### Payment Method-Specific Rules
1. **PIX has 30min QR expiry** — auto-expires, customer can regenerate
2. **Card requires 3DS** — handled by Stripe PaymentElement
3. **Cash requires admin confirmation** — `cash_pending` → `paid` is admin-only
4. **PIX regeneration rate limited** — 3/hr per customer, 5/order total
