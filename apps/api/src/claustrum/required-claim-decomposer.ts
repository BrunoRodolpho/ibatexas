// required-claim-decomposer.ts — the REQUIRED-CLAIM DECOMPOSER (SDD §O#15; Plan 1
// Phase 3 round-2 addendum). A DETERMINISTIC, PLANNER-INDEPENDENT,
// CONSERVATIVE-OVER-DECOMPOSING stage that sits UPSTREAM of the planner: given the
// intent / span-classes of the request, it declares the MANDATORY required-claim-
// type set the turn MUST resolve. The downstream completeness check (P4) then
// quantifies over THIS required set — NOT the planner's chosen candidates — so a
// turn cannot render literal-true-but-INCOMPLETE (omitting a companion claim the
// question logically required).
//
// WHY upstream + planner-independent (SDD §O#15): if completeness quantified only
// over the candidates the (probabilistic) planner CHOSE, the planner could satisfy
// completeness by simply not proposing the awkward companion (a "render the easy
// half" hole). By fixing the required set from a DECLARED closure table keyed by
// the request's span-class — before and independent of what the planner proposes —
// the required companion can never be silently dropped: it is either VALIDATED or
// the turn DEGRADES (UNKNOWN/ESCALATE/CLARIFY), never literal-true-but-partial.
//
// CONSERVATIVE-OVER-DECOMPOSING: when a span matches multiple classes (or its
// class is uncertain), the required set is the UNION — we over-include companions
// (stricter completeness), never under-include. Adding a required claim can only
// DEGRADE a turn (demote-only), never falsely promote it.
//
// SCOPE (SDD §Q scope guard): the Trustworthiness-Triad slice (STORE_OPEN_NOW,
// ORDER_FULFILLMENT_STAGE, PAYMENT_STATUS). The full closure table over the 37-row
// registry is the deferred follow-on; this proves the MACHINERY + the Triad rows.
//
// PURE & self-contained: no clock / RNG / IO; no model import; no kernel-downstream
// import beyond the `RegistryClaimType` it quantifies over.
